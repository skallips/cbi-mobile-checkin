# cbi-mobile-checkin

In order to comply with company pandemic guidelines implementing a no-contact check in experience, this project provides a prototype representation of a mobile check-in app for guests to complete registration.  Within the app/website, guests will be able to verify reservation information, acknowledge property policies, and review additional resort instructions and information without physically being present in resort lobby.

Sample of protype was presented to the GPR MIS team for initial review and analysis.  Workflow concept from prototype was later adopted and integrated to work with SPI system using .NET frameworks, with launch date targeted for resort reopening date of 6/2020.  Note: Attached is an unfinished commit version of project prior to project hand off to MIS team.
